# The Programming Languages Zoo

The Programming Languages Zoo, or *PL Zoo* for short, is a collection of implementations
of miniature programming languages which demonstrates various techniques used in
implementation of programming languages. It is a good starting point for those who would
like to implement their own programming language, or just learn how it is done.

The languages demonstrate various aspects of implementation, such as:

* source code parsing (using a parser generator)
* pretty-printing of error messages and results
* how to report source-code positions
* interactive toplevel shell
* non-interactive file processing
* typed and untyped languages
* eager and lazy evaluation strategies
* subtyping, parametric polymorphism, and other kinds of type systems
* type checking and type inference
* functional, declarative, object-oriented, and procedural languages
* recursive definitions
* exceptions
* compilation to an assembly-like language
* abstract machine
* interpreter
* unification

## Licensing

The PL Zoo is open source, see the file `LICENSE.markdown` for licensing information.

## Prerequisites

To compile the code you will need:

* [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org/) programming language, version 4 or later,
* [menhir](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/) parser generator.

A good way to get started with OCaml is to use the OCaml pagackage manager
[OPAM](http://opam.ocaml.org/), through which menhir is available. Both OCaml and OPAM are
available through package managers on Linux and OS X, see instruction on the [OPAM web
site](http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).

### Recommended: `ledit` or `rlwrap`

It is recommended that you install [ledit](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~ddr/ledit/) or
[rlwrap](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap) command-line editing wrappers. Check your
package manager, it probably knows about them. They will be detected and automatically
used by the toplevel interactive loop.

## Installation

Get the source from GitHub:

    git clone git@github.com:andrejbauer/plzoo.git

or via the HTTP protocol

    git clone https://github.com/andrejbauer/plzoo.git

Then you should compile the languages:

    make all

You can also compile a single language with

    make <lang>

The compilation procedure will create native code executables. To generate bytecode use

    make BUILD=byte all

There is `make clean` if you want ot clean up.

## Usage

The languages are not really meant to be used. Rather, you should read the source code,
which is decorated with ample comments, and study it. Also, each language `lang` has its
own `README.markdown` and `example.lang` in the subdirectory `src/lang`.

Nevertheless, all the language are functioning miniature versions of real languages that
can be executed. You can:

1. Run the toplevel with `./lang.native`
2. Run files non-interactively with `./lang.native <file> <file> ...`
3. Load files and enter the toplevel `./lang.native -l <file> -l <file> ...`

## Contributing

Contributions are *very* welcome. They are great service to the community and 


If you would like to contribute to the project, please contact us through GitHub:

* If you discover a problem, open an issue about it.
* Even better, fix the problem and submit a pull request!
* If you would like to help but do not know how, have a look at open issues and volunteer
  to resolve one.
* If you have an idea for a new language, discuss it in an issue, or just go ahead if you
  can't wait.

We kindly ask that contributions to the repository follow the established pattern. For
example, all the main programs are generated with the `Zoo.Main` functor found in
`src/zoo.ml`. It takes care of a number of things, such as command-line wrappers, standard
command-line options, loading of files, and running an interactive shell. It is best if
you start by copying one fo the existing languages and adapt it to your language.
