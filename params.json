{"name":"Programming Languages Zoo","tagline":"Implementations of programming languages","body":"The *Programming Languages Zoo*, or *PL Zoo* for short, implements\r\na variety of programming languages. The implementations are purposely\r\nkept simple and to the point so that they are a good starting point\r\nfor those who would like to implement their own programming language,\r\nor just learn how it is done.\r\n\r\nThe PL Zoo is open source, see the file `LICENSE.txt` for licensing information.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nTo compile the PL Zoo you will need:\r\n\r\n* [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org/) programming language, version 4 or later,\r\n* [menhir](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/) parser generator.\r\n\r\nA good way to get started with OCaml is to use the [Ocaml Package\r\nManager](http://opam.ocamlpro.com/), through which menhir is available.\r\n\r\n## WARNING\r\n\r\nAt the moment the PL Zoo is undergoing a major reorganization. I am porting it to Github\r\nand consolidating the various programming languages into a more unified library. Please\r\nstay tuned.","google":"UA-43528302-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
