{"name":"Programming Languages Zoo","tagline":"Learn how to implement a programming language","body":"The *Programming Languages Zoo* implements a variety of programming languages. The implementations are purposely kept simple and to the point so that they are a good starting point for those who would like to implement their own programming language, or just learn how it is done.\r\n\r\nThe PL Zoo is open source, see the file `LICENSE.txt` for licensing information.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nTo compile the PL Zoo you will need:\r\n\r\n* [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org/) programming language, version 4 or later,\r\n* [menhir](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/) parser generator.\r\n* The `make` program.\r\n\r\nOptionally, you should install `ledit` or `rlwrap` command-line editing wrappers. If you do, the language toplevels will automatically use them.\r\n\r\n## Compilation\r\n\r\nTo build everything type `make`. You can also compile a specific language `X` by typing `make X.native`.\r\n\r\n## WARNING\r\n\r\nAt the moment the PL Zoo is undergoing a major reorganization. I am porting it to Github\r\nand consolidating the various programming languages into a more unified library. Please\r\nstay tuned.\r\n","google":"UA-43528302-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
